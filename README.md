# Pong remake in Godot 4

This is an exercise of making a Pong game remake with Godot (4.1.1) [live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMwTaV1q4sI). The font that was used in this game isn't open sourced, so either change it in the editor, or buy it on [itch.io](https://chevyray.itch.io/pixel-fonts).
